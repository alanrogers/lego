=======

Legofit is a computer package that uses counts of nucleotide site
patterns to estimate the history of population size, subdivision, and
gene flow.

=======

This branch will implement Composite Likelihood Information Criterion or CLIC into Legofit.  This will assist the software in model selection, as currently this can only be done easily with models that are nested.
