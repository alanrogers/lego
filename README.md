Legofit
=======

Legofit is a computer package that uses counts of nucleotide site
patterns to estimate the history of population size, subdivision, and
gene flow.

Documentation begins [here](http://content.csbs.utah.edu/~rogers/src/legofit/index.html)

=======

This branch will implement bootstrap estimates of prediction error, or BEPE, into Legofit.  This will, in conjunction with CLIC, assist the software in model selection, as before the addition of CLIC this could only be done easily with models that are nested.

*This README subsection should be removed before or just after merge*

*NOTE: StrDblStack Should be renamed StrDblQueue; however, we will wait till BEPE and CLIC are merged to do so though*
